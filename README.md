## Plan
1. Perform image segmentation on the images to remove any distracting background features.

2. Use (Fisher's) Linear Discriminant Analysis to quickly train hand classifiers for Histograms of Oriented Gradients.

3. Use Adaboost to ensemble differently shaped HOG classifiers into a "boosted" classifier.

4. Use image segmentation to also find the shadows of the hands

5. Perform steps 2 and 3 for the shadows too.

6. PROFIT
